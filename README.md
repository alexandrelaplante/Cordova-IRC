Cordova IRC
===========
This is a simple IRC plugin for Corodova/PhoneGap.

Status
------
The current version of this plugin can simply connect to a given IRC channel and read responses, as well as send messages. Extensive testing has not been done, and I would consider this an early alpha (if even that).

TODO
----
1. Changing nicks
2. Disconnecting
3. Changing Channels
